### Components

* Frame
	* Tri-(3), Quad-(4), Hexa-(6) or Octo(8)copter
	* 3-copter is cheaper, less complicated => My choice
	* Size of frame: Farthest distance 2 motors are apart 
		* Nano Drone: 80-100 mm
		* Micro Drone: 100-150 mm
		* Small Drone: 150-250 mm
		* Medium Drone: 250-400 mm
		* Large Drone: 400+ mm
	* My choice is small (150-250)
* Motors
	* Brushless vs Brushed
	* Brushless: less weardown but more expensive => My choice
	* Motor size format: XXYY, where XX=width of stator and YY=height of rotor, more width=more torque
	* KV rating: RPMs per volt of input 
	* Low KV => more torque; larger props
	* High KV => less torque; smaller props => what i want
* Propellers (props)
	* format: XXYY, where XX=diameter of prob, YY=pitch (inch)
	* more pitch => more air pushed down (screw comparision)
	* High KV => lower pitch
* Electronic speed controller (esc)
* Lipo battery
	* Capacity 
	* C rating 
* Microcontroller 
	* Control flight & power
* GPS module
* Camera module
* Gyro module 
* Accerleometer module
* 2x GCS module (on drone & on ground)
	* Sending commands
	* Receiving data

### Part selection


#### Thrust/Weight ratio

Should be Approx. 2/1 for normal use 
I will be aiming for a TW > 2

#### Frame

Form: Quadcopter (No one builds tricopters apparently) 
Size: 150-250 mm
Two ruler + screws = frame
